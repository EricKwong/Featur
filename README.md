# featur

featur is an app featuring the collaboration of Eric, John and Emily.

### Purpose
featur allows a user to search for an artist and his or her collaborators to see what tracks the two have recorded together. Make playlists based on your results, or search for a collaborator as the main artist to explore the six degrees of separation between artists.

featur relies on the data from Spotify's API.

### How to Use
1. Search for an artist.
2. Choose an artist from your search results, most likely the first result.
3. Marvel in the glory of all the collaborations!
3. Click the collab artist's picture to see the tracks the two artists have recorded together.
4. Create a new playlist. 
5. Add songs that you like to your playlist when you are checking out collaborated tracks.
6. Sign in to Spotify to listen to your playlist.
7. Continue searching by making a collaborator the main artist searched.
